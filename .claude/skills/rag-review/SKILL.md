description: Use when reviewing or auditing a RAG pipeline end-to-end against production best practices. Covers all 8 stages — ingestion/chunking, versioning/updates, embedding/indexing, query routing, retrieval/fusion/reranking, generation/abstention, security, and eval/observability. Triggers on phrases like "review RAG pipeline", "audit RAG", "RAG E2E review", "is this RAG production ready", "check RAG implementation", "RAG pre-merge review", "review this RAG code".

# RAG E2E Review Checklist

## Iron Law

> **A RAG pipeline ships only when retrieval, generation, security, AND eval all pass. Three out of four is a production incident.**

This skill is the single source of truth for "what does a production-grade RAG pipeline look like across all 8 stages." Reviewers cite reference files for detail — they do not restate content here.

## How to use this skill

**For human users:** Invoke `/rag-review` for an E2E audit. For deeper review, dispatch `@rag-implementation-reviewer` or `@rag-pipeline-reviewer` — both auto-load this skill.

**For agents consuming this skill:** Walk the 8 stages in order. For every check, cite the file:line of the authoritative reference. Don't manufacture findings — if a stage is clean, say so in one line.

## Severity rubric

| Severity | Meaning | Verdict impact |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Security incident, data integrity, prompt injection, hallucination on high-risk path | BLOCK |
| 🟠 **High** | Production correctness, recall ceiling, missing audit log, missing abstention | NEEDS_REVIEW (fix before merge) |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Quality + ops drift (no eval gate, no per-axis breakdown, missing cache) | NEEDS_REVIEW (recommend) |
| 🟢 **Low** | Hygiene (missing comments, magic numbers, undocumented alpha) | APPROVE with note |

## Stage 1 — Ingestion & Chunking

Cross-refs: `rag-architect/references/advanced-chunking-guide.md`, `rag-architect/references/table-chunking-strategy.md`

| # | Check | Severity if failing | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Parser matches corpus type — not raw `pdf.extract_text()` for complex PDFs; Unstructured.io or LlamaParse for table-heavy docs | 🟠 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §6` |
| 1.2 | Document-aware chunking on headings/sections — NOT fixed-size sliding window as the only strategy | 🟠 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §1` |
| 1.3 | Chunk size calibrated by document type: prose 500–800 tokens, structured/SOP 300–600, tables = whole or row-groups | 🟡 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §1` + `rag-operations-guide.md §6` |
| 1.4 | 10–20% overlap on fixed-size strategies (unless chunking on natural boundaries like paragraphs) | 🟡 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §1` |
| 1.5 | Stable chunk IDs: `(document_id, document_version, chunk_index)` — never auto-increment IDs | 🟠 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §4` |
| 1.6 | Required metadata per chunk: `document_id`, `chunk_id`, `tenant_id`, `source_uri`, `section_title`, `page`, `chunk_index`, `embedding_model`, `chunker_version`, `parser_version`, `content_hash`, `created_at` | 🟠 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §4` (16-field schema) |
| 1.7 | Tables NOT split mid-row; column headers repeated in every row-group chunk | 🔴 | `table-chunking-strategy.md §3` |
| 1.8 | High-stakes tables stored with multiple representations (plain text + Markdown + JSON) | 🟡 | `table-chunking-strategy.md §4` |
| 1.9 | OCR quality gate applied before ingestion: per-character confidence threshold checked, garbled text rejected | 🟡 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §6` |
| 1.10 | Parent-child relationship stored when narrow questions need surrounding context | 🟡 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §1.4` |

---

## Stage 2 — Versioning, Updates & Deletion

| # | Check | Severity if failing | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Two-level hash gate implemented: document hash (fast skip) AND chunk hash (exact diff) — NOT document hash alone | 🟠 | `incremental-ingestion-guide.md §1` |
| 2.2 | Text normalized before hashing (whitespace, page numbers, timestamps stripped) to prevent false re-embeds from formatting noise | 🟠 | `incremental-ingestion-guide.md §2` |
| 2.3 | Stable chunk IDs enable clean upsert — changed chunk updates in place, does not create duplicate vector | 🔴 | `incremental-ingestion-guide.md §3` |
| 2.4 | Soft-delete: removed chunks set `is_active=false`; retrieval filters `WHERE is_active = true` | 🔴 | `incremental-ingestion-guide.md §4` |
| 2.5 | Version fields stored per chunk: `embedding_model`, `chunker_version`, `parser_version`, `normalizer_version` | 🟠 | `incremental-ingestion-guide.md §5` |
| 2.6 | Versioning metadata: `effective_from`, `effective_to`, `superseded_at` — default retrieval filter `superseded_at IS NULL` | 🟠 | `versioning-and-freshness.md §2–3` |
| 2.7 | New document version supersession runs in a single atomic transaction (marks old superseded + inserts new together) | 🔴 | `versioning-and-freshness.md §5` |
| 2.8 | Historical query detection implemented — temporal keywords trigger `effective_from`/`effective_to` filter instead of current-only filter | 🟡 | `versioning-and-freshness.md §4` |
| 2.9 | GDPR/RTBF: hard-delete across all versions (vector index + metadata + caches); audit log entry retained forever even after deletion | 🔴 | `versioning-and-freshness.md §8` |

|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Embedding model pinned as a constant or env config — NEVER inline string literal at each call site | 🔴 | `vector-database/SKILL.md` |
| 3.2 | `embedding_model` version stored in chunk metadata so index-time and query-time models can be verified | 🔴 | `advanced-chunking-guide.md §4` |
| 3.3 | Query and index use the SAME distance operator (`cosine <=>` matches `vector_cosine_ops` index) | 🔴 | `vector-database/references/ann-vs-knn.md` |
| 3.4 | ANN/HNSW used for production retrieval; KNN/Flat reserved for golden-set eval baseline and scoped high-risk paths | 🟠 | `vector-database/references/ann-vs-knn.md` Decision rule |

## Stage 4 — Query Understanding & Routing

Cross-refs: `rag-architect/references/query-classification-taxonomy.md`, `rag-architect/references/query-transformation-guide.md`

| # | Check | Severity if failing | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Query classification covers the 9 canonical intent classes (`factual_lookup`, `policy_question`, `structured_record_lookup`, `comparison`, `summarization`, `multi_hop`, `troubleshooting`, `personalized`, `unsafe`) | 🟠 | `query-classification-taxonomy.md §1` |
| 4.2 | Structured record lookups (exact IDs, counts, current account state) route to SQL/API — NOT RAG | 🔴 | `query-classification-taxonomy.md §4` |
| 4.3 | `unsafe_or_disallowed` class refuses before any retrieval takes place; attempt is audit-logged | 🔴 | `query-classification-taxonomy.md §1` |
| 4.4 | Router type matches corpus complexity: rule-based for v1 (< ~30 rules), classifier for more; LLM router only for agentic flows | 🟡 | `query-classification-taxonomy.md §3` |
| 4.5 | Conversational follow-up queries rewritten (pronouns resolved, standalone query) before retrieval | 🟠 | `query-transformation-guide.md §1` |

|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Hybrid retrieval: dense + BM25 — or documented measured justification for skipping sparse | 🟠 | `rag-architect/SKILL.md` Step 1 |
| 5.2 | Fusion via RRF (k=60) — NOT ad-hoc weighted score blending without normalization | 🟠 | `rag-architect/SKILL.md` Step 1 |
| 5.3 | **Pre-filtered ANN** (filters in vector DB call) — NEVER post-filter on top-k results | 🔴 | `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md §1` |
| 5.4 | `top_k_retrieve` >> `top_k_final`: retrieve 50–80 candidates, rerank down to 5–10 for generation | 🟠 | `rag-operations-guide.md §6` |
| 5.5 | Cross-encoder reranker present on production paths | 🟠 | `rag-architect/SKILL.md` Step 1 |
| 5.6 | Environment-aware reranker: local/dev uses lighter model (Gemini Flash); staging/prod uses production-grade (Vertex AI Ranking API) | 🟡 | `rag-operations-guide.md §5` |
| 5.7 | Query embedding cache keys include `tenant_id` — NOT query text alone | 🔴 | `rag-operations-guide.md §1` |

|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Strict grounding prompt: "answer ONLY using the provided context" — no room for LLM to draw on training data | 🟠 | `context-packing-patterns.md §3` |
| 6.2 | Structured answer contract returned (not free-form prose with embedded citations the system can't parse) | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §1` |
| 6.3 | Per-claim citations — every factual sentence in the answer carries a `[chunk_id]` reference | 🟠 | `context-packing-patterns.md §3` |
| 6.4 | `schema_version` emitted on every response | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §8` |
| 6.5 | `status` field is a value from the closed 7-value enum (`answered`/`partial`/`abstained`/`clarification_needed`/`tool_error`/`policy_blocked`/`no_retrieval`) | 🔴 | `rag-response-contract.md §3` |
| 6.6 | `no_retrieval` status is explicitly policy-governed — NOT used as a silent fallback that bypasses RAG | 🔴 | `rag-response-contract.md §3` |
| 6.7 | `confidence_level` is a band (`high`/`medium`/`low`) — NEVER raw float exposed to UI | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §4` |
| 6.8 | Confidence derived from evidence signals (retrieval score, rerank score, citation coverage, freshness), NOT from LLM self-report | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §4` |
| 6.9 | Faithfulness gate implemented: if faithfulness < threshold (~0.7), band clamped to `low` regardless of weighted score | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §4` |
| 6.10 | `safety` block emitted on every response — missing block ≠ empty `{}` | 🔴 | `rag-response-contract.md §6` |

| 6.13 | Internal-only fields (`relevance_score`, `retrieval_metadata`, `trace`, `usage`, raw `chunk_id`) stripped before response reaches client | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §2` |
| 6.14 | Abstention enforced at agent/pipeline layer via calibrated threshold checks — NOT relying solely on LLM prompt instruction | 🔴 | `abstention-decision-framework.md §3` |
| 6.15 | All 8 abstention triggers handled: no context, off-topic retrieval, missing clause, conflicting docs, citation unsupported, stale evidence, high-risk domain without grounding, required doc not retrieved | 🟠 | `abstention-decision-framework.md §3` |
| 6.16 | Refusal text uses one of the 4 named templates (missing context / weak context / conflicting context / high-risk) — NOT free LLM improvisation | 🟡 | `abstention-decision-framework.md §6` |
| 6.17 | `clarification_reason` field REQUIRED when `status = clarification_needed` | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §3` |
| 6.18 | Streaming uses 6-event model (`status`/`answer_delta`/`citation`/`warning_flag`/`answer_span`/`done`); `answer_span` emitted only after generation is complete, NOT mid-stream | 🟠 | `rag-response-contract.md §7` |

## Stage 7 — Security

**This stage delegates to `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md` — do NOT duplicate it here.** Load that skill in parallel when reviewing security-sensitive RAG code. The five items below are the minimum gate; the dedicated skill has full coverage.

| # | Minimum gate (full coverage in rag-security-reviewer) | Severity | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Pre-filtered ANN at a SINGLE chokepoint — NEVER post-filter on top-k for security enforcement | 🔴 | `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md §1–2` |
| 7.2 | Retrieved content treated as untrusted: clear delimiters in prompt, no tool-call execution allowed from retrieved text | 🔴 | `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md §3` |
| 7.3 | Per-response audit log: `request_id`, `user_id`, `tenant_id`, `filters_applied`, `chunks_used`, `model`, `prompt_version`, `latency_ms` | 🔴 | `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md §4` |
| 7.4 | PII redaction at ingest AND at response (`safety.redactions[]`) | 🔴 | `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md §5` + `rag-response-contract.md §6` |
| 7.5 | Right-to-be-forgotten tested end-to-end: vector index + BM25 index + metadata + all caches; audit log entry retained | 🔴 | `rag-security-reviewer/SKILL.md §6` + `versioning-and-freshness.md §8` |

If ANY 🔴 item in Stage 7 fails, the review verdict is **BLOCK** regardless of other stages.

## Stage 8 — Evaluation & Observability

Cross-refs: `rag-evaluator/SKILL.md`, `rag-architect/references/rag-operations-guide.md`

| # | Check | Severity if failing | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Golden set exists with ≥ 50 labeled queries — or has a concrete plan with date | 🔴 | `rag-evaluator/SKILL.md` Golden set design |
| 8.2 | Coverage targets met: ~60% happy path, ~20% edge cases, ~20% known unanswerable | 🟠 | `rag-evaluator/SKILL.md` Coverage targets |
| 8.3 | CI gate configured: fails build on Recall@K, Faithfulness, or Citation Quality regression beyond tolerance | 🔴 | `rag-evaluator/SKILL.md` CI gate pattern |
| 8.4 | Abstention metrics tracked as two separate rates — False Abstention Rate + False Answer Rate — NOT collapsed into one metric | 🟠 | `rag-evaluator/SKILL.md` Answer metrics |

| 8.8 | Async eval pattern: sample 1–10% of production traffic via trace store — NOT inline in sync response path | 🟡 | `rag-response-contract.md §1` |
| 8.9 | Corpus hygiene checks run after bulk ingestion: near-duplicate detection (`content_hash` dedup), stale/superseded doc sweep, authority tagging for canonical versions | 🟡 | `rag-operations-guide.md §9` |
| 8.10 | Post-ingestion smoke test runs after every ingestion that changed ≥ 1 chunk; ingestion trace logged | 🟡 | `incremental-ingestion-guide.md §7` |
| 8.11 | p95 latency target defined and monitored per stage: query embedding ≤ 50ms, ANN retrieval ≤ 200ms, reranker ≤ 250ms, LLM first token ≤ 500ms, total ≤ 2s | 🟡 | `rag-operations-guide.md §4` |

## Maintenance note

When a new reference file is added to any sibling skill (`rag-architect`, `rag-evaluator`, `rag-security-reviewer`, `vector-database`, `rag-debugger`), update the corresponding stage table here in the same PR. The skill is the single point of update; the consuming agents (`rag-implementation-reviewer`, `rag-pipeline-reviewer`) and command (`/rag-review`) inherit automatically via `skills:` frontmatter.
