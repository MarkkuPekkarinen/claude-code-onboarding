# Docker Orchestration Reference

Read when health-check waits, port conflicts, or compose-file orchestration cause issues.

## docker-compose.yml minimum

```yaml
services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=debug
      # auth tokens, DB URLs, etc.
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 6
      start_period: 10s
```

The `healthcheck` block is what `run_validation.sh` polls indirectly (it
hits the URL itself, but Docker's healthcheck affects `docker compose ps`
output, useful for diagnostics).

## Wait strategies (ranked best to worst)

1. **HTTP poll on `/health`** (current default in `run_validation.sh`)
2. **Docker healthcheck status poll** — `docker inspect ... --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}'`
3. **Fixed `sleep 10`** — fragile, never use this in a feedback loop

## Common failure modes

### Port already in use
Symptom: `bind: address already in use` during `docker compose up`.
Fix: orchestrator's `--force-recreate` handles re-creating the container,
but if another process owns the port, you'll need to stop it. Check:
```bash
lsof -i :8080
```

### Health endpoint missing
If your MCP server doesn't expose `/health`, add one. For Python MCP servers
using FastAPI/Starlette under the hood:
```python
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
@app.route("/health")
async def health(_): return JSONResponse({"status": "ok"})
```

### Container exits immediately
The validator will time out on health check. Diagnose with:
```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100 mcp-server
```
The orchestrator dumps these logs automatically on health-check timeout.

### Auth secrets in containers
Use `.env` file referenced from `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
env_file:
  - .env.test
```
Never commit `.env.test`. Add to `.gitignore`. The validator
reads `SERVER_URL` etc. from environment, so the same `.env.test` can be
sourced before running `bash tests/run_validation.sh`.

### stdio transport (for MCP servers without HTTP)

If your MCP server only supports stdio, skip Docker entirely for testing:
```bash
SERVER_URL="stdio://python -m mcp_server" \
HEALTH_URL="" \
bash tests/run_validation.sh
```
And modify `run_validation.sh` to skip Docker steps when `HEALTH_URL` is empty.
